//! Integration Tests for Simplified Routing
//!
//! Tests the simplified routing functionality including:
//! - v1.0 backward compatibility with static routing
//! - v2.0 agent decision-based routing
//! - Routing trace generation and observability
//!
//! NOTE: Tests temporarily disabled during routing simplification refactor

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    // TODO(v0.2): Rewrite these tests for the new agent decision-based routing
    // See DYNAMIC_ROUTING_ANALYSIS.md for implementation status
    // Dynamic routing is 80% complete and marked experimental in v0.1.0
    // Tests will be completed when routing algorithm is finalized

    #[test]
    #[ignore = "Tests need to be rewritten for new routing approach (v0.2)"]
